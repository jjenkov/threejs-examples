# Three.js Examples
This repository contains a list of Three.js examples and experiments. 
The Three.js website is located at:

[Threejs.org](https://threejs.org)

To get the examples to work, you need to:

 - Clone this repository
 - Create a directory named "js" inside the root directory of this project (on your disk).
 - Download Three.js and store it inside the newly created "js" directory.

 - You may have to start a web server, and have the root directory of this project as the root directory of a website,
   and load the examples via this web server (instead of directly from the disk). The web server MiniWeb can work.
